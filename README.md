# SQL Studies through DataCamp Practice 📊

This repository is my personal learning log for studying **SQL for data analysis** through hands-on practice. It contains the queries I developed while completing the **Associate Data Analyst in SQL** career track on DataCamp.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate core SQL concepts, analytical thinking, and data-driven decision making by keeping a structured and reusable collection of queries built throughout the learning journey.

## 📌 About this repository  
This repository follows a progressive learning path, starting from SQL fundamentals and evolving toward advanced analytical techniques. The queries were written as part of guided exercises, case studies, and analytical scenarios proposed in the DataCamp track.

Rather than focusing on isolated syntax examples, the emphasis is on **using SQL to explore data, generate insights, and support decisions**, mirroring real-world analytical workflows.

## 📚 Contents  
The repository is organized by topic or course, reflecting the structure of the learning track. It includes queries related to:

01. Introduction to SQL;
02. Intermediate SQL;
03. Joining Data in SQL;
04. Data Manipulation in SQL;
05. PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions;
06. Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL;
07. Introduction to Statistics;
08. Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL;
09. Data-Driven Decision Making in SQL;
10. Understanding Data Visualization;
11. Data Comunication Concepts.

Each file represents a specific topic or course and can be read independently as a reference.

## ▶️ How to use  
The SQL files can be viewed directly on GitHub or executed locally using any SQL-compatible environment (such as PostgreSQL). Some queries are written with PostgreSQL syntax and functions in mind.

## 📝 Notes  
This is a **study-focused repository**. The main objective is clarity, incremental learning, and documentation of the reasoning behind each query. The repository is intended to serve as a long-term reference when working on data analysis, BI, or analytics projects.
